This repository is mostly full of projects that I have made during one of my first courses on Flutter mobile development.

It contains mostly basic projects maily for learning the basics of Flutter & Dart, but also a few more intermediate projects.

**CONTENT**

1. **Mi Card**

   A very basic flutter app with just 1 screen that has basic information related to me (icon, email, phone)

2. **BMI Calculator**

   Just as it says, a simple BMI Calculator with 2 screens. Some features are not working as they are only for design purpose.

3. **Destini**

   A little Choose Your Own Adventure type of app with a few screens and interactive buttons on each screen. Choices reflect on which screen is pushed next.

4. **Dicee**

   Another basic name for another basic app. No animations added, just a very basic dice app that randomises 2 dice images on the screen.

5. **MeteoNow**

   Probably the most interesting app in this List. The MeteoNow app shows the weather in your area and a few other info such as UV, wind speed, pressure. The background image is set to change based on the current weather. Looking to implement the ability to search weather data by city input and also add a few more weather information.

6. **Quizzler**

   A True or False type of app with a set number of questions, nothing crazy added and it has mostly just basic features

7. **XylophoneApp**

   An App created mainly for playing around with the audio packages. It plays a different audio for each button pressed.
   
8. **Coin Ticker**

   An App that shows the current exchange rates of Bitcoin, currently planning to implement ETH and LTC. There is a total of 20 currencies ready to be used.
